        <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime whose gravitational effects are so strong that not even light can escape from it.
            Many black holes, especially those that are stellar-sized, are formed from massive stars that ran out of fuel. The stars have to
            have a mass that is at least equivalent to the Oppenheimer-Volkov limit. Stars that are at least 18 times as massives as the Sun
            are thought to leave black holes. Black holes are generally invisible. However, they often have accretion disks that indicate its presence.
        </p>

        <p>Black holes are thought to exist in the center of most galaxies. Their mass is at least a million times the mass of the Sun.
            These are called supermassive blackholes. Our own Milky Way has a black hole called Sagitarrius A*. It is 4.3 million solar masses.
        </p>

        <p>
        Black holes can be defined in terms of three properties: mass, angular momentum, and charge. A black hole that is not charged but rotates
        is called a Kerr black hole. A black hole that is not charged and does not rotate is called a Schwarzschild black hole. Most black holes
        are Kerr black holes. That is because the star they formed from had angular momentum.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>The edge of a blackhole is called an event horizon. The distance from the center of the black hole to the event horizon is called a 
            Schwarzschild radius. If you compress an object to its Schwarzschild radius, it will become a black hole. The formula to determine
            the Schwarzschild radius is:

        <p>As one can see, the Schwarzschild radius depends on the object's mass. To determine the Schwarzschild radius of an object, type its
            mass in kilograms: </p>
        
        Mass: <input type="number" id = "massStatement" oninput="myFunction(this.value)"><br>

        <p>
        General relativity predicts that there are singularities within the event horizon. A singularity is a point that has infinite density
        and infinite spacetime curvature. To test the predictions of general relatives, one would have to go inside the event horizon. However,
        it would be impossible to publish the results due to two reasons: extreme time dilation and extreme tidal forces. In the event horizon, there would
        time, as observed from outside, is thought to be infinite. As a result, it would be impossible to relay the results. Additionally, due
        to large gravitational forces, tidal forces can be apparent even at small distances, so your body can be stretched apart in a process called
        spaghettification. This can tear your body apart, killing yourself in the process.
