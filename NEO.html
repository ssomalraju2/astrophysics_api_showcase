    <p>
    A Near Earth Object (NEO) is any solar system object that comes near Earth. By convention, if an object's closest approach to the Sun is less than
    1.3 astronomical units, it is considered an NEO. NEOs are typically asteroids, but a small number are comets. If a NEO's orbit crosses the Earth's 
    and is larger than 140 meters, it is considered a potentially hazardous object (PHO). Below is an image of Comet Hartley, as seen by NASA's <em>Deep Impact</em>
    probe. Comet Hartley is an example of a near-Earth comet.
